This is a Game Boy emulator written in Rust. A lot of the code is inspired by and sometimes adapted from Rylev’s emulator and his online tutorials, which were super helpful while learning.
This project is mainly for learning and experimenting. I built it to:
Get more comfortable with low-level programming in Rust
Better understand how CPUs actually work under the hood
And look good on a resume
